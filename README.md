# Learning OpenGL in C

Here I am attempting to cut my teeth in programming in order to create my very own
rendering library for OpenGL in the hopes that I can make an easy abstraction
over OpenGL.

I am following along with the LearnOpenGL book/website

## Goals

- learning graphics programming
- library design
- abstractions design
